  <h1>Udacity Notes  </h1>
    <p>These are my notes for the introduction to programming course by <strong>Udacity</strong></p>
    <h3>My intentions</h3>
    <p><i>I intend to learn quickly and I am determined to work on the projects with the right determination and commitment.</i></p>
    <h3>Some sidenotes beforehand</h3><p>Most stuff<br>About HTML<br>I already know<br>However I have plenty to learn and <br> <u>Practice</u> in particular</p>
    <h3>First findings!</h3><p><em>apparently writing stuff in ""em" tags does the same as </em><br> <i>writing stuff in "i" tags</i></p>
   <p>I have found some very interesting <a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Markup_Language">links</a></p>
   <h3>Final remarks for now!</h3>
      <p>All in all I hope to be a happy coder in time :)<br> <img src="http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-happy-coding.png"></p>
